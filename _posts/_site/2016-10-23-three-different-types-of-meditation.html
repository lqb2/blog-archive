<p>earlier this week i was reading <a href="resiliencethebook.com">resilience</a> and something blew my mind. the chapter is entitled ‘the resilient mind’ and, somewhat obviously, meditation came up. the section introed with descriptions of three different types of meditation.</p>

<p>i was in a reading flow so i didn’t stop, but since then i’ve looked up more information on the different types. i think had sensed and heard from friends (mostly danielle) that there were different types of meditation. but never did i think they fit so neatly into categories with such clear boundaries and specific benefits.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mum.edu/academic-departments/maharishi-vedic-science/mvs-topics/three-types-of-meditation/">this post</a> on the maharishi university of management’s website explains the differences resonably well (maybe not <em>that</em> well, though). it does include this somewhat helpful graphic:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mum.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Three-Categories-of-Meditation31250.png" alt="three types of meditation" /></p>

<p>it’s not a particularly beautiful graphic, but academic/university graphics haven’t really ever been. maybe i’ll remake it someday.</p>

<p>anyway, what’s hitting me right now is that the three different types have different impacts. focused attention (like zen and vipassana), open monitoring (like mindfulness), and loving-kindness/automatic self-transcending (i don’t really understand this one and don’t have any good examples) all seem to have different methods and impacts.</p>

<p>i’m think what i’m coming to realize here is that there’s much more to meditation than i expected.</p>

<p>awesome. let the journey begin (continue)!</p>
