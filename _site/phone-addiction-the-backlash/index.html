  <h1>phone addiction: the backlash</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>a few days ago, <a href="twitter.com/rchanowski">ross</a> shared a pretty epic article with me called <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-binge-breaker/501122/">binge breaker</a>. the subject of the piece, tristan harris, is in line with thinking i’ve been doing on technology for a while. having read sherry turkle’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alone-Together-Expect-Technology-Other/dp/0465031463">alone together</a> in undergrad, people’s addiction to their phones became a bit of an obsession (is it weird to be addicted to people being addicted? lol). i was so into it that it shaped all of my photography <a href="lawrencebarrinerii.com/art">in college</a> and has shaped <a href="peopleonphonesinpublicorprivate.tumblr.com">some of it</a> since.</p>

<p><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/527fdb09e4b0a82a76942ecf/527fe6a8e4b096cf32d53fb6/527fe6e4e4b05645e634f9cd/1434390263061/Slide+1.jpg?format=1500w" alt="#alonetogether" /></p>

<p>the point of these photos for me was to reflect back to people how ridiculous we look when we zombie through the world on our phones.</p>

<p>harris in this article is leaps and bounds ahead of my thinking on it. having learned from the thought leaders of the behavioral principles behind the phone addicting features, he has swung hard in the opposite direction. he’s even started an organization, <a href="http://timewellspent.io/">time well spent</a>, that has the intent of supporting a shift to more human-centered app and tool design.</p>

<p>some of my favorite quotes from the article (<a href="https://www.highly.co/hl/5806abb47c712f6a80000068">which i highlighted</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“While some blame our collective tech addiction on personal failings, like weak willpower, Harris points a finger at the software itself. That itch to glance at our phone is a natural reaction to apps and websites engineered to get us scrolling as frequently as possible. The attention economy, which showers profits on companies that seize our focus, has kicked off what Harris calls a “race to the bottom of the brain stem.” “You could say that it’s my responsibility” to exert self-control when it comes to digital usage, he explains, “but that’s not acknowledging that there’s a thousand people on the other side of the screen whose job is to break down whatever responsibility I can maintain.””</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…technology is not, as so many engineers claim, a neutral tool; rather, it’s capable of coaxing us to act in certain ways.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“companies “stand back watching as a billion people run around like chickens with their heads cut off, responding to each other and feeling indebted to each other.””</p>
</blockquote>

<p>having read the piece, i’m now feeling pretty angsty about some of these “innovations” that are making it harder for peope to resist addiction to their phones. although i can’t say i’m firm on them, i do wonder (and think i’m against) about two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>infinite scroll (pages that automatically load up with new content once you get to a certain point) seems likely to have the exact same outcomes as the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15761167">bottomless bowl experiment</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>phones not being able to be grayscale. in ios 9 and earlier (as far as i know), there was an option in the accessibility menu to turn your phone screen grayscale. i had actually done it for a while after watching <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/480240/adventures-in-grayscale/">this video</a>. when i went to go turn it back on the other day, i found that in ios 10, the option has vanished. wtf?</p>
  </li>
</ol>
