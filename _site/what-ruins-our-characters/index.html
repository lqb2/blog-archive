    <p>another piece of this death thought bubble is another thing seneca said in one of his letters to lucilius. in <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_83">letter LXXXIII (83)</a> he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For this is what makes us wicked: that no one of us looks back over his own life. Our thoughts are devoted only to what we are about to do. And yet our plans for the future always depend on the past.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i think this is true from the individual life up to the scale of geology. when we try to understand what’s possible moving forward without understanding what has happened in the past, we really just fuck it up. it might be not understanding where we come (family &amp; place) from as individuals or where not seeing where the roots of our society and culture are. either way, when things go wrong, many times there are historical forces at play as well as present realities. sure, you may want to be an all-star athlete but if your parents didn’t teach you to be active when you were growing up, that’s a much bigger hindrance to your path than your occasional lack of motivation. that just puts you behind the ball of the person who’s parents are both college athletics coaches. it doesn’t make it impossible, but we should all at least be honest with the cards we’ve been dealt.</p>

<p>i think a big flaw in our western, individualistic society is that we’re culturally trained to see ourselves as individuals. this shortsightedness really just obscures huge parts of our realities. if we could, individually and societally, take the time to look back at our lives and just reflect, i think we’d all be in better places.</p>

<p>as my buddy <a href="http://lqb2quotes.tumblr.com/post/145586733722/life-is-really-just-about-shitty-models-and-their">spencer once said</a>, “life is really just about making shitty models and error correction.”</p>

<p>i’m not totally sure how to handle moving america towards that as a country, but i can certainly start with myself. hence, my personal retreat…</p>
