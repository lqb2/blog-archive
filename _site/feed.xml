&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-the-most-of-friends-while-theyre-still-alive&quot;&gt;making the most of friends while they’re still alive​​&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, my dear Lucilius, behave in keeping with your usual fair-mindedness and stop misinterpreting the kindness of fortune. She has given as well as taken away. Let us therefore go all out to make the most of friends, since no one can tell how long we shall have the opportunity. Let us just think how often we leave them behind when we are setting out on some long journey or other, or how often we fail to seem them when we are staying in the same area, and we shall realize that we have lost all too much time while they are till alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/post/145892324822/hugs&quot;&gt;this is the reason i hug people so fiercely&lt;/a&gt; every time you leave someone, you never know if that’s the last time you’ll see them. we should act like that every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is also part of the thrust behind my “go big/go deep or go home” mantra. that started with me from my tallahassee christian youth group crew (mostly roshad), but now has taken on this added meaning. since this might be the last time i see you, let’s make the most of the time we have now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some people might think that would get exhausting. and maybe it does. but in the ten-ish years i’ve been living like that, it has yet to get exhausting to me. if anything, it makes people (myself included) happier to see someone that next time. it makes it feel more like a gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;finally, this phenomenon of not seeing people while they’re in town and then when they’re gone (whether they move or die) is hilarious to see written about during the time of seneca’s life, 4 B.C. to 65 a.d.* so knowing that it’s been a problem forever, we just need to make active decisions to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is a big part of why i’ve decided to just get very clear (sometimes painfully explicit, even to myself) with who my close friends are. then i set up regular hang out sessions with them so that i don’t fall into this trap. it’s tough, but you really can’t be close with everyone all the time. so it’s better, imo, to just look that in the face and deal with it in a concrete way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friends-stay-with-you-even-after-death&quot;&gt;friends stay with you even after death&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let us see to it that recollection of those we have lost becomes a pleasure to us. Nobody really cares to cast his mind back to something which he is never going to think of without pain. Inevitable as it is that the names of persons who were dear to us and are now lost should cause us a gnawing sort of pain when we think of them, that pain is not without a pleasure of its own. As my teacher Attalus used to say, ‘In the pleasure we find in the memory of departed friends there is a resemblance to the way in which certain bitter fruits are agreeable or the very acidity of an exceedingly old wine has its attraction. But after a certain interval all that pained us is obliterated and the enjoyment comes to us unalloyed.’ … Thinking of departed friends is to me something sweet and mellow. For when I had them with me it was with the feeling that I was going to lose them, and now that I have lost them I keep the feeling that I have them with me still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it’s interesting that we do think of death as this irreversible moment that changes things forever. and, to be sure, it definitely does. but sometimes i find myself or hear others discussing death like we’re going to forget. but, like seneca said, my experience has shown that not to be true. people who i’m really close to and are alive have basically the same relationship to me and my thoughts when they’re dead. i’ve only had a few friends die so far, but the ones that i thought about often were that way because our lives were intertwined in such an intense way for so long that many things remind me of them. whether or not they’re alive, those things still remind me of them. similiarly, friends i don’t think about often are that way before or after their death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-happen-at-any-time-today--death-doesnt-play-by-seniority&quot;&gt;what can happen at any time today / death doesn’t play by seniority​&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I realize now that my sorrowing in the way I did was mainly due to the fact that I had never considered the possibility of his dying before me. That he was younger than I was, a good deal younger too, was all that ever occurred to me – as if fate paid any regard to seniority! So let us bear it constantly in mind that those we are fond of are just as liable to death as we are ourselves…  Now I bear it in mind not only that all things are liable to death but that that liability is governed by no set rules. Whatever can happen at any time can happen today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i totally fall into this trap all the time. somehow, i expect that people will die in a linear order from oldest to youngest. experience has obviously proven that to be otherwise, but i get it. the general trend is that the older people get, the more likely it is that they will die due to a body that’s unable to bounce back. and yet, people die of the unexpected and uncontrollable all the time. not only that, but it seems like the number of people i know who are getting and dying from cancer at early ages is skyrocketing. maybe i’m wrong, but i can see it happening all around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so this idea that people die off in age order really just isn’t that helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;phew. that took longer and is longer than i expected it would be, but, hey, i’m on vacation. i’ll write as long as i want i guess, heh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*  we, definitely myself included, like to imagine that “things were different back then,” but they just weren’t. the problems we’re dealing with now seem to have been the problems we’ve been dealing with for all of time. they might look different, but it seems increasingly clear that they’re the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’m fairly obsessed with the american anti-obsession with death. the lengths american society goes to to avoid thinking about, dealing with, seeing in real ways, and coping with the fact that we’re all going to die one day are amazing. i think a large portion of the issues american society faces flow from this aversion. i could go on and on about this, but that’s not the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the point today is to start dealing with it myself. and i’ll start with my own death (because i almost always think the place to start in in oneself). i think this may become an annual tradition. who knows. here goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it’s nearing the end of 2016 and i’m thinking about my death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my first thought: i am resigned to the reality that one way or another, the oppressive systems we live in will probably kill me. if it’s not a bullet or other direct assault from a human it may be the climate and resulting catastrophe or it may be cancer from the toxic environments/lifestyles we’ve created for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or maybe I’ll die of old age and my body ceasing to function in a way that keeps my soul in it. that’s fine, too. it feels less likely, but hey, nothing’s impossible. and maybe i’ll look back at this when i’m 90 and think “what a ridiculous thing i wrote.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;either way, this note about my death is actually about how i want to live (knowing that i will die):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i hope that some people i crossed paths with know what it feels like to be loved because of me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i hope that people and the world are better because of my life, relationships, and work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i would love to be a part of ending hunger worldwide&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i hope to be part of bringing about new ways of living that help people live lives more aligned with their true selves, people arond them, and the planet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if there’s an afterlife, i hope that the things i did while alive land me on the side of it where there’s contentment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;whether i die later today, tomorrow, or in some years, i hope i’m able to genuinely &lt;a href=&quot;http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/post/141849731677/timelines-of-change-living-everyday-like-its-the&quot;&gt;live every day like it’s my last and also like i’ll live till i’m old&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ps - also, i didn’t commit suicide. if shit gets crazy, don’t let anyone tell you i killed myself. i will never kill myself. if you hear it on tape, i was tortured. i promise. &lt;a href=&quot;http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/post/141082081412/two-defining-factors%5D&quot;&gt;i have already died once&lt;/a&gt; and that experience taught me that life is much too precious to willingly end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;DR. KARR: Yeah. I love that. I mean, I love that thing Thomas Keating says about practicing mindfulness, and that it’s sort of like — there’s a bunch of water that has mud and silt in it, and the longer you practice, the more that just kind of settles to the bottom, and you don’t feel any peace. You might practice for days and weeks, and it’s just cloudy and noisy. And he says what you don’t realize is that healing is happening, that that stuff — by doing that, you are settling it, but you don’t notice it because it hasn’t settled yet. You have to just — how difficult just to keep sitting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this has been exactly how meditation has benefitted me over the last couple of years. i started trying to meditate daily in jan 2015. i hit 250/365 days that year and, as far as i can remember, i’ve meditated 10+ minutes every day this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at first, i didn’t really notice anything. it didn’t seem like much was changing about anything i could sense or feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then, during the summer, i started meditating before i went to work. i noticed a significant difference in my ability to assess situations more thoughtfully. i could just see into a situation with more perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that fall, when i got a new job, i began to notice that i could notice when i wasn’t focused. i would be focusing on a particular work task and then i would feel myself reaching for something unrelated. like… i could sense my brain wander away from what i was doing. or, to be more explicit, i noticed when thoughts crept in that weren’t related to what i was working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that proved to be unbelievably valuable because i could then either (a) find a way to deal with the distraction (which often just involved writing it down to do later) or (b) put it aside and refocus. either way, both of those options were better than what i would do previously, which was let the thought actually distract me and then snap out of it (texting, facebook, email, twitter, reading random articles) 30+ minutes later and wonder ‘wtf have i been doing?!?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;these two last things i’ve gained from daily meditation are probably the most impactful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by noticing which thoughts wander into my brain during meditation (i.e. what’s on my mind), i’m able to better parse out what is taking up my mental energy.&lt;/em&gt; that allows me to, outside of meditation, handle those things that would have taken up lots of mental energy over the day. i’m then freer to focus on other things with more calm and clarity. the positive impact of this cannot be understated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;learning to let my thoughts come and go with the trust that the important things will come back when they need to. sometimes during the day i’ll remember something that seems &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; important but i won’t have time to process it properly. then, i would beat myself up and try &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; hard to think of the thing i had forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;it turns out, as i’ve meditated more and more, i’ve noticed that my brain is actually quite adept at not letting me forget &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; important things. the really important things always come back up (often during meditation, but not always). i’m able to process the thought then if i missed it the first time. and if a thought doesn’t come back up, it honestly probably wasn’t that important. now, i know that’s a very common trope that’s often seen as trite, but i’ve really begun to trust it lately and it’s brought a lot more ease to my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so yea. it really feels like the process of muddy water settling. you don’t necessarily notice it day-to-day, but over time, the ability to see through the increasingly clear water provides huge benefits. you just have to let it settle enough to get there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">another insight that has stuck with me from the mary karr episode of on being is from the following paragraph (so glad the on being podcast episodes have full transcripts):</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">the diversity/bandwidth tradeoff</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/the-diversity-bandwidth-tradeoff/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="the diversity/bandwidth tradeoff" /><published>2016-10-31T06:11:28-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-31T06:11:28-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/the-diversity-bandwidth-tradeoff</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/the-diversity-bandwidth-tradeoff/">&lt;p&gt;in the paragraph &lt;a href=&quot;http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/post/152509089972/the-four-characteristics-of-the-best-teams&quot;&gt;immediately preceding the one i wrote about yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, the authors describe something called the diversity/bandwidth tradeoff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“As we expand the diversity of social connections we have, the bandwidth we can commit to each of those connections becomes more limited, and the information that comes from them gets weaker and narrower. And that in turns makes weak ties suitable for certain kinds of work and strong ties suitable for others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i think about this &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; time. the two most common contexts for me are productivity and social connections, but it comes up in other places, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the productivity front, it shows up as needing to make tough choices about priorities (the last part of the quote above about weak ties vs strong ties isn’t really relevant for the productivity front, but it is for the social). it means recognizing that you can’t do everything. and you can really only do a few things at the same time if you want to do any of them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on one hand, that reality has to do with amassing resources. building knowledge (and sometimes a network, too) relevant to what it is you’re trying to do requires focus. whether its raising a family or becoming an opera star, the more you can focus, the faster and more deeply you’ll learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the other hand, it has to do with creativity. in order to be creative, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ceros.com/blog/the-art-and-science-of-generating-great-ideas/&quot;&gt;our brains actually need to have some open space (as simon martin mentions over on the ceros blog in his recent post on the art and science of generating great ideas)&lt;/a&gt;. when focusing on too many different things, your brain doesn’t have space to make connections because it’s too busy trying to hold information. and as david allen, one of my productivity gurus says, “the brain is a great place for having ideas, not holding them.” you can’t generate new ideas in your lanes of focus if your brain is too busy holding ones you’ve already had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the diversity/bandwidth tradeoff shows up in a parallel way socially to the productivity breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for example, when i was in grad school, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/post/145062715257/on-saying-no&quot;&gt;i really tried to do everything&lt;/a&gt;. this resulted in me running myself ragged. &lt;a href=&quot;http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/post/150726651967/turns-out-you-cant-be-good-friends-with-everyone&quot;&gt;what i’ve been learning this year&lt;/a&gt; is that it’s super important (and very counter-cultural) to have a clearly delineated group of close friends and focus on those friendships intensely. yes, this means that being close to everyone is not possible, but it allows three things. (1) it allows us to build the type of deep friendship that we all crave (the “i would drop whatever i’m doing if you needed me” type of friendship). (2) it allows spontaneity in those friendships because you aren’t overcommitted. (3) when do you do hangout with someone outside of your inner circle, it means you can show up fully for that person because you’re not exhausted from giving too much to too many different people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of course, there is always a balance. it’s not good to only be thinking about just one thing or have just one friend. but most people (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/post/146158937647/why-i-plan-my-schedule-six-weeks-in-advance&quot;&gt;myself included&lt;/a&gt;) try to do way too much and it undermines their success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sidenote: on this friend front, i think there may be a lot more to this that belongs in another post… for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;maybe this theory is why having a small number of close friends and many distant ones is good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i wonder if people and communities would be better if we thought strategically about this from an early age? what if we taught our children that their lives would be the most fulfilling if their thought about their friendships like this? what if the design of our physical communities supported and encouraged friendships like this? hm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The most powerful constellation seems to be to have small, diverse teams of strongly tied collaborators, who each have a large and diverse weak-tie network — the best of both worlds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they break it down in the chapter differently, but here are the parts of that that seem critical to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;small&quot;&gt;small&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the team needs to be small enough to not have to coordinate too many pieces. in the last few years of my career, i’ve seen this play out as logisitical coordination RE calendars and locations to meet, but it can show up in other ways, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;diverse&quot;&gt;diverse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;actual and cognitive diversity are really important. they give a team the ability to think deep and wide and make breakthroughs in ways that teams that are too similar can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strongly-tied&quot;&gt;strongly-tied&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the team members need to be strongly tied. this means that, even though they should have different cognitive abilities, they should be similar enough to work well together. there’s nothing worse than having a dysfunctional team. in fact, i often tell my friends that if their relationship with their boss isn’t a good one, the awesomeness of the work their doing isn’t worth staying. it’s a pattern i’ve seen over and over. but i digress…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;with-many-weak-ties&quot;&gt;with many weak-ties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;each team member should have a large and diverse network (i.e. many weak ties). this allows the core team to have access to knowledge resources without needing to have them all in house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the more i think about it, the more i think these four points are how to make the world a more beautiful, functional place, while also shifting some of the terror that is the large corporation. maybe this thinking could/should play out in how we structure our social lives and physical communities as well.
hm!&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">this resilience book is pretty dope. the chapter that i’m in now is about resilience groups and teams. after lots of different cases and data, they make this claim about teams (page 187):</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">cognitive diversity, actual diversity, and the benefits of both</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/cognitive-diversity-and-actual-diversity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="cognitive diversity, actual diversity, and the benefits of both" /><published>2016-10-29T07:03:28-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-29T07:03:28-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/cognitive-diversity-and-actual-diversity</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/cognitive-diversity-and-actual-diversity/">&lt;p&gt;pages 204-208 in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.resiliencethebook.com&quot;&gt;resilience&lt;/a&gt; have two really fascinating cases that make two astounding points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cognitive diversity on a team can compensate for and even create better outcomes than intelligence on a team, and 
actual diversity and cognitive diversity together can be mutually reinforcing and beneficial. 
so what does all that mean? i’ll explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cognitive-diversity&quot;&gt;cognitive diversity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;scott page is a professor of complex systems, political science, and economics and the university of michigan. he defines cognitive diversity as such: the distribution of different kinds of thinkers within a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;kevin dunbar, a psychologist at the university of toronto, studied cognitive diversity and its impacts on team performance. turns out that having a team with a high (but not too high) level of cognitive diversity can create higher levels of performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dunbar took two scientific research labs and studied them in their actual research environments. team x had a high level of overall intelligence but a relatively narrow range of scientists. team y had a much more diverse set of scientists (i’m not sure how the intelligence level compared). the labs have no connection to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at one point, teams x and y ran into a similar problem. team y, the cognitively diverse team, solved the problem in two minutes at a single meeting. team x was still struggling with the problem two months later. i can only imagine how much time and progress team x wasted trying to solve a problem that team y solved in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dunbar’s theory is that having different ways to think about a problem allows more access to alternative thinking about potential solutions. when people in a group think similarly, for example, they tend to use similar and more complex metaphors to describe situations because they have shared understanding of the knowledge required to make sense of them. teams with different thinking and backgrounds tend to use more basic but wide ranging types of metaphors in order to spam knowledge gaps between members. this allows more diverse ways of thinking about the same problem which seems to lead to solution faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now all of this said, there are certainly tradeoffs to having more diverse teams over similar teams. as with everything, there’s a balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;teams with low cognitive diversity have low startup costs because they share language and knowledge. the means they can probably move faster when things are going well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;teams with high cognitive diversity have high communications cost. they can’t easily explain their thinking to others without shared backgrounds so they spend extra time doing so. however, the benefit that that creates is ability to blast through problems quickly, as opposed to getting bottle-necked by a lack of ability to think outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;actual-diversity&quot;&gt;actual diversity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in a similar way, “actual” diversity (gender, class, race, etc.) also has benefits. the example used in the book was about gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when men find lab surprising lab results, they tend to assume they know why and keep moving forward (in my opinion, this is an effect of socialization, not physiology). either way, this pattern has the effect of sending teams down wrong pathways. incorrect early assumptions lead to wasted time down the road and makes it difficult to backtrack to find mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;women, however, tend to try to stop and explain surprising results by doing more rigorous testing. by looking for ways to recreate the results, they generate more firm data and thus a higher ability to explain results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now, from the outside, this may look like women are slower or less aggressive researchers. however, in reality, women are just as aggressive about their research; they just go about the work in completely different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one thing i’ve definitely been doing is writing. it’s been an important part of this year for me and so i’ve been thinking about it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the more i think about it the more reasons i find that i’m doing it, so here’s what i have so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as i’ve started my productivity coaching practice, i’ve learned that having specific thoughts packaged neatly makes for easy sharing of information to people i’m working with. i can process a thought once and then share it over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-create-ripples&quot;&gt;to create ripples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a few days ago i finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+BYAaOyolQ/&quot;&gt;the mary karr episode of on being&lt;/a&gt;. right before the end of the episode there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+BYAaOyolQ/45:23&quot;&gt;krista reads a snippet from karr’s book&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Art-Memoir-Mary-Karr/dp/0062223070&quot;&gt;the art of memoir&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“none of us can ever knowthe value of our lives or how our separate and silent scribbling may add to the amenity of the world if only by how radically it changes us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she basically said that writing (1) changes her during the process of putting the thoughts down and (2) has impact in the world because sharing how you perceive and experience the world can make tiny changes in how other people think about the world and that can have serious implications on their thinking, which influences their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-the-memories&quot;&gt;for the memories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the first episode of harry potter and the sacred text season 2 (one of my favorite new podcasts), my friend casper &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+GS5VDYBB4/24:54&quot;&gt;reflects on his last living grandparent dying&lt;/a&gt;. he mentioned that each time someone dies, all their memories are lost forever (well, i guess those that aren’t currently already living in someone else’s head). he then said that as he thinks about his experiences that only he knows about, if he writes them down, they’ll be around even after he isn’t. and in reference to a particular passage of harry potter that they’re discussing, he said that writing is a good way to make sure that things you experienced weren’t a dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, i’m sure there are more reasons that will come up as i think through this more. maybe i’ll keep updating this post; maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">as i start thinking ahead to 2017 (it’s barely 60 days away), i’ve begun reflecting on how i’ve been spending my time in 2016 (because life’s too short to not learn as fast as possible. so what have i been doing and why?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">spiritual practice, not belief</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spirituality-practice-not-belief/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="spiritual practice, not belief" /><published>2016-10-27T06:18:28-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-27T06:18:28-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spirituality-practice-not-belief</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spirituality-practice-not-belief/">&lt;p&gt;i just finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+BYAaOyolQ/&quot;&gt;the mary karr episode of on being&lt;/a&gt;. honestly, it had the air of one of the episodes that i tend to skip because of the framing of the title: “astonished by the human comedy.” just didn’t seem appealing to me. i’m glad i listened anyways. i probably have four different thought posts inspired by the content, though they did all come in the last 15 minutes of the episode. just goes to show that you really can’t judge things by their outward appearances (or that you shouldn’t make assumptions… or something, heh).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, here’s a paraphrase of one of the first section &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+BYAaOyolQ/40:04&quot;&gt;(and here’s a timestamped link to the podcast episode so you can listen for yourself)&lt;/a&gt; that really stuck with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the people who follow jesus, more so than people who call themselves christians or catholics or whatever seemed to always be the ones working in the soup kitchen and also seemed the least hateful and angry… that’s why i started trying to figure out the whole jesus thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that totally resonated with me because i had a very similar trajectory. the only real different is that i started out in the church. i rejected the blind faith and dogma because it just didn’t seem effective or impactful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, just as i was having that thought… she dropped this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… that’s why it’s a spiritual practice and not just a spiritual belief. people talk about doctrine all the time (and even fight about it) but what i care about what you do on a given day. i don’t care so much what you believe in; what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bam. totally same lane as me. i loved her leaning into the framing of spirituality as a practice. practice is action based (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lqb2quotes.tumblr.com/post/150233304527/love-is-an-action-a-participatory-emotion&quot;&gt;similar to love&lt;/a&gt;). given how i’ve seen christianity (and many other religions) be destructive, i wonder if this way of thinking about spirituality and spiritual differences would allow a much more healthy coexistence of multiple religions/spiritual practices… i know for me, i don’t particularly care what you believe, as long as it impacts your life and the world positively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the 40-hour work week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/09/viral-image/does-8-hour-day-and-40-hour-come-henry-ford-or-lab/&quot;&gt;which was advocated for by labor activists on behalf of workers who were working 70 hour weeks, but also a little bit from henry ford&lt;/a&gt;, made (more) sense in an industrial era. when you and your organization produce widgets at a certain rate productivity can absolutely be measured in time. 100 widgets (cars, bikes, planes, stamps, pencils, whatever) per hour times the number of hours is your output. it makes sense in that context that, if you’re being paid on output, that measuring time is an appropriate proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;however, the outputs of knowledge work are totally different. first of all, the what that is being produced has totally changed. knowledge workers produce so many different things that it’s nearly impossible to imagine comparing them all with a single metric (output per unit time). additionally, how those outputs are produced varying wildly. not only do they vary from job to job, but sometimes within a single person’s role in a single organization, producing the first “thing” can take a week, the second can take a year, and the third could take two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are a ton of other reasons why counting time fails in a world of knowledge work, but for now, i’ll let that be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what i really want to be thinking about is how to shift into a new frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the past few months, ross and i have been tossing around terminology like ‘full-focus’ versus full-time. full-focus, although imperfect, implies more directly that your production is aimed towards a single job (or task or whatever). it then doesn’t matter how long it takes you to produce what it is you produce. as long as you get it done when it needs to be done, it shouldn’t matter how long it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there’s more to this thinking, but, as hemingway used to say, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openculture.com/2013/02/seven_tips_from_ernest_hemingway_on_how_to_write_fiction.html&quot;&gt;“Always stop for the day while you still know what will happen next.”&lt;/a&gt;. my ten minutes for today (15) is up!&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">let’s be honest: time management fails knowledge workers (i wrote about a piece of this over here. anyone who has worked a desk job is keenly aware of this. it shows up in all sorts of ways. dragging out or procrastinating on simple tasks and being overworked despite a clearly defined set of deliverables are just two examples.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">phone addiction: the backlash</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/phone-addiction-the-backlash/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="phone addiction: the backlash" /><published>2016-10-25T06:08:28-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-25T06:08:28-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/phone-addiction-the-backlash</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/phone-addiction-the-backlash/">&lt;p&gt;a few days ago, &lt;a href=&quot;twitter.com/rchanowski&quot;&gt;ross&lt;/a&gt; shared a pretty epic article with me called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-binge-breaker/501122/&quot;&gt;binge breaker&lt;/a&gt;. the subject of the piece, tristan harris, is in line with thinking i’ve been doing on technology for a while. having read sherry turkle’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Alone-Together-Expect-Technology-Other/dp/0465031463&quot;&gt;alone together&lt;/a&gt; in undergrad, people’s addiction to their phones became a bit of an obsession (is it weird to be addicted to people being addicted? lol). i was so into it that it shaped all of my photography &lt;a href=&quot;lawrencebarrinerii.com/art&quot;&gt;in college&lt;/a&gt; and has shaped &lt;a href=&quot;peopleonphonesinpublicorprivate.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;some of it&lt;/a&gt; since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/527fdb09e4b0a82a76942ecf/527fe6a8e4b096cf32d53fb6/527fe6e4e4b05645e634f9cd/1434390263061/Slide+1.jpg?format=1500w&quot; alt=&quot;#alonetogether&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the point of these photos for me was to reflect back to people how ridiculous we look when we zombie through the world on our phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;harris in this article is leaps and bounds ahead of my thinking on it. having learned from the thought leaders of the behavioral principles behind the phone addicting features, he has swung hard in the opposite direction. he’s even started an organization, &lt;a href=&quot;http://timewellspent.io/&quot;&gt;time well spent&lt;/a&gt;, that has the intent of supporting a shift to more human-centered app and tool design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some of my favorite quotes from the article (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.highly.co/hl/5806abb47c712f6a80000068&quot;&gt;which i highlighted&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“While some blame our collective tech addiction on personal failings, like weak willpower, Harris points a finger at the software itself. That itch to glance at our phone is a natural reaction to apps and websites engineered to get us scrolling as frequently as possible. The attention economy, which showers profits on companies that seize our focus, has kicked off what Harris calls a “race to the bottom of the brain stem.” “You could say that it’s my responsibility” to exert self-control when it comes to digital usage, he explains, “but that’s not acknowledging that there’s a thousand people on the other side of the screen whose job is to break down whatever responsibility I can maintain.””&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…technology is not, as so many engineers claim, a neutral tool; rather, it’s capable of coaxing us to act in certain ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“companies “stand back watching as a billion people run around like chickens with their heads cut off, responding to each other and feeling indebted to each other.””&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;having read the piece, i’m now feeling pretty angsty about some of these “innovations” that are making it harder for peope to resist addiction to their phones. although i can’t say i’m firm on them, i do wonder (and think i’m against) about two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;infinite scroll (pages that automatically load up with new content once you get to a certain point) seems likely to have the exact same outcomes as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15761167&quot;&gt;bottomless bowl experiment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;phones not being able to be grayscale. in ios 9 and earlier (as far as i know), there was an option in the accessibility menu to turn your phone screen grayscale. i had actually done it for a while after watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/480240/adventures-in-grayscale/&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. when i went to go turn it back on the other day, i found that in ios 10, the option has vanished. wtf?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
