        <p>while on this death kick, i remembered that <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_63">letter LXIII (63) from seneca, on grief for lost friends</a>, addressed the topic of friends and grief. it had some pretty great insights as they related to death. i think i’ll just put down each quote and then my little reflection after each one.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>i just finished <a href="https://overcast.fm/+BYAaOyolQ/">the mary karr episode of on being</a>. honestly, it had the air of one of the episodes that i tend to skip because of the framing of the title: “astonished by the human comedy.” just didn’t seem appealing to me. i’m glad i listened anyways. i probably have four different thought posts inspired by the content, though they did all come in the last 15 minutes of the episode. just goes to show that you really can’t judge things by their outward appearances (or that you shouldn’t make assumptions… or something, heh).</p>

        <p>a few days ago, <a href="twitter.com/rchanowski">ross</a> shared a pretty epic article with me called <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-binge-breaker/501122/">binge breaker</a>. the subject of the piece, tristan harris, is in line with thinking i’ve been doing on technology for a while. having read sherry turkle’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alone-Together-Expect-Technology-Other/dp/0465031463">alone together</a> in undergrad, people’s addiction to their phones became a bit of an obsession (is it weird to be addicted to people being addicted? lol). i was so into it that it shaped all of my photography <a href="lawrencebarrinerii.com/art">in college</a> and has shaped <a href="peopleonphonesinpublicorprivate.tumblr.com">some of it</a> since.</p>
