  <h1>inequity averson</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>there is a section in <a href="resiliencethebook.com">resilience</a> about inequity aversion. it’s one of those things that is simultaneously blowing my mind and yet obvious.</p>

<p>the experiment described in the book to discuss this involved chimpanzees, cucumbers, and grapes. two chimps were each taught to complete a simple task. upon completion, they would each be given a slice of cucumber. at some point, one of the chimps, in full view of the other, began to get grapes as a reward.</p>

<p>now, chimps like cucumbers and grapes, but they prefer grapes (as do i, heh). now, under rational actor theory, the cucumber chimp should still complete the task. based on the information she has, completing the task will still net her a cucumber slice she wouldn’t have otherwise had.</p>

<p>however, as you’ve probably already guessed, the cucumber chimp began to complete the task more reluctantly. i think eventually she even stopped doing the task completely.</p>

<p>why? the theory lines up with what most of us have learned through life. we’re generally willing to engage in activities that benefit us, but as soon as we believe someone else is getting more for the same task, we begin to act “irrationally.”</p>

<p>this (along with many other experiments and data points) disproves rational actor theory. life is not simply a maximization problem for individuals. nor can society be described (as much as adam smith and milton friedman are misquoted as believing) the outcome of many individuals maximizing their self-interest.</p>

<p>that’s just not how it works and that should have a huge impact on how we build and create. obviously, my mind goes to the corruption in finance and highly paid executives, but the implications are broader than that i think. what would happen if the discussion about wages in america kept inequity aversion in mind?</p>

<p>i wonder if this is a part of why <a href="http://www.oecd.org/social/inequality.htm">countries with lower relative levels of wealth inequality seem to do better</a> and <a href="http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/09/12/record-high-income-inequality-threatens-us-growth">those with high do worse</a>…</p>
